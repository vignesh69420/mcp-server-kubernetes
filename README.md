## Usage with Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kubernetes": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-kubernetes"]
    }
  }
}
```

The server will automatically connect to your current kubectl context. Make sure you have:

1. kubectl installed and in your PATH
2. A valid kubeconfig file with contexts configured
3. Access to a Kubernetes cluster configured for kubectl (e.g. minikube, Rancher Desktop, GKE, etc.)

You can verify your connection by asking Claude to list your pods or create a test deployment.

If you have errors, open up a standard terminal and run `kubectl get pods` to see if you can connect to your cluster without credentials issues.

## In Progress

- [ ] [Docker support](https://github.com/Flux159/mcp-server-kubernetes/pull/9)

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Flux159/mcp-server-kubernetes.git
cd mcp-server-kubernetes
bun install
```

### Development Workflow

1. Start the server in development mode (watches for file changes):

```bash
bun run dev
```

2. Run unit tests:

```bash
bun run test
```

3. Build the project:

```bash
bun run build
```

4. Local Testing with [Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector)

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js
# Follow further instructions on terminal for Inspector link
```

## Architecture

This section describes the high-level architecture of the MCP Kubernetes server.

### Request Flow

The sequence diagram below illustrates how requests flow through the system:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Transport as StdioTransport
    participant Server as MCP Server
    participant Handler as Request Handler
    participant K8sManager as KubernetesManager
    participant K8s as Kubernetes API

    Client->>Transport: Send Request via STDIO
    Transport->>Server: Forward Request

    alt Tools Request
        Server->>Handler: Route to tools handler
        Handler->>K8sManager: Execute tool operation
        K8sManager->>K8s: Make API call
        K8s-->>K8sManager: Return result
        K8sManager-->>Handler: Process response
        Handler-->>Server: Return tool result
    else Resource Request
        Server->>Handler: Route to resource handler
        Handler->>K8sManager: Get resource data
        K8sManager->>K8s: Query API
        K8s-->>K8sManager: Return data
        K8sManager-->>Handler: Format response
        Handler-->>Server: Return resource data
    end

    Server-->>Transport: Send Response
    Transport-->>Client: Return Final Response
```

## Not planned

Authentication / adding clusters to kubectx.
